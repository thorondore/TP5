# TP5: Image Formation
## Exercise 1: Implementation

### Question 1.  How does the image change if we modify the following parameters: focal length, object transform, image center, and image resolution ?


Here are the result we got for onmy changing the focal. The focal values are (from left to right and up to down): 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1, 2, 10.

<img src="Focal_0.1.png" width="300">
<img src="Focal_0.3.png" width="300">
<img src="Focal_0.5.png" width="300">
<img src="Focal_1.png" width="300">
<img src="Focal_2.png" width="300">
<img src="Focal_10.png" width="300">

We can see that increasing the focal makes the object of the image bigger. it also reduces the image depth. It makes sens when we look at the formula : the smaller the focal is, the bigger the denominator is. Furthermore, when f tends toward infinity, X_img and Y_img have X_p' and Y_p' as limits.
